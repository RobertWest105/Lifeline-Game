# Lifeline-Game
An arcade-style game made in Unity with C#.

Move left and right along the Lifeline while rotating it around yourself to avoid the Heartstopper demon.

The Heartstopper will speed up over time so you will need to collect speed-up hearts to stay one step ahead.

How long can you survive?
